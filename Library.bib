	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11026},
	abstract = {In this paper we present a scheme for the numerical solution of one-dimensional stochastic diﬀerential equations ({SDEs}) whose drift belongs to a fractional Sobolev space of negative regularity (a subspace of Schwartz distributions). We obtain a rate of convergence in a suitable L1-norm and we implement the scheme numerically. To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst paper to study (and implement) numerical solutions of {SDEs} whose drift lives in a space of distributions. As a byproduct we also obtain an estimate of the convergence rate for a numerical scheme applied to {SDEs} with drift in Lp-spaces with p ∈ (1, ∞).},

	abstract = {Backwards Stochastic Differential Equations ({BSDEs}) have been widely employed in various areas of applied and financial mathematics. In particular, {BSDEs} appear extensively in the pricing and hedging of financial derivatives, stochastic optimal control problems and optimal stopping problems. Most {BSDEs} cannot be solved analytically and thus numerical methods must be applied in order to approximate their solutions. There have been many numerical methods proposed over the past few decades, for the most part, in a complex and scattered manner, with each requiring a variety of different and similar assumptions and conditions. The aim of the present paper is thus to systematically survey various numerical methods for {BSDEs}, and in particular, compare and categorise them. To this end, we focus on the core features of each method: the main assumptions, the numerical algorithm itself, key convergence properties and advantages and disadvantages, in order to provide an exhaustive up-to-date coverage of numerical methods for {BSDEs}, with insightful summaries of each and useful comparison and categorization.},

The state process consists of the storage level controlled by the storage manager and the energy price process, which is a diffusion process the drift of which is assumed to be unobservable. We apply filtering theory to find an alternative state process which is adapted to our observation filtration. For this alternative state process, we derive the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation and solve the optimization problem numerically. This results in a candidate for the optimal policy for which it is a priori not clear whether the controlled state process exists. Hence, we prove an existence and uniqueness result for a class of time-inhomogeneous stochastic differential equations with discontinuous drift and singular diffusion coefficient. Finally, we apply our result to prove admissibility of the candidate optimal control.},

It is an attempt to give a reasonably self-contained presentation of the basic theory of stochastic partial differential equations, taking for granted basic measure theory, functional analysis and probability theory, but nothing else. The approach taken in these notes is to focus on semilinear parabolic problems driven by additive noise. These can be treated as stochastic evolution equations in some infinite-dimensional Banach or Hilbert space that usually have nice regularising properties and they already form a very rich class of problems with many interesting properties. Furthermore, this class of problems has the advantage of allowing to completely pass under silence many subtle problems arising from stochastic integration in infinite-dimensional spaces.},

            A simple rigorous approach is given to generalized functions, suitable for applications. Here, a generalized function is defined as a genuine function on a superset of the real line, so that multiplication is unrestricted and associative, and various manipulations retain their classical meanings. The superset is simply constructed, and does not require Robinson's nonstandard real line. The generalized functions go beyond the Schwartz distributions, enabling products and square roots of delta functions to be discussed.},
